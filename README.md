# TIL(Today I Learned)
>"The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one." - Malcolm Forbes

This is a collection of short articles about things I've learned. 

The articles are much shorter than those posted on a [blog](https://colevelup.tistory.com/), but they serve as a source of information.

I stole this idea from the famous Git repository [jwworth/til](https://github.com/jwworth/til), [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/), [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) and developers who work hard every day for TIL.

The TIL's starting readme was written in English as a tribute to [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/) and the articles will be written in Korean
