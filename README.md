# TIL(Today I Learned)
>"The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one." - Malcolm Forbes

This is a collection of short articles about things I've learned. 

The articles are much shorter than those posted on a [blog](https://colevelup.tistory.com/), but they serve as a source of information.

I stole this idea from the famous Git repository [jwworth/til](https://github.com/jwworth/til), [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/), [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) and developers who work hard every day for TIL.

The TIL's starting readme was written in English as a tribute to [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/) and the articles will be written in Korean

TIL을 기록하기 위해 만든 Git Repository 입니다.\
저의 [개발블로그]()에 올라가는 글보다는 짧게 작성하지만 블로그 글을 작성하는데 토대 가되는 지식들을 하나하나 적어 나가려 합니다.

아이디어는 유명한 Git 저장소 [jwworth/til](https://github.com/jwworth/til), [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/), [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) 그리고 TIL을 위해 매일 힘을 쓰는 개발자들에게서 훔쳐왔습니다.
